JIT

*J*ust *I*nstall *I*t.

Reason
=======

Each OS have an especific package manager, with some specific name for each package. And each version of the same distribution the name of package can change, so if you want to install a package or you have a team and they need some tools to work properly.

Or simply, do you have some software instaled at your OS, and that software are cross platform and you need them installed at other computers. Or you'll format you computer and you need to maintain the softwares installed.

The main reason for JIT is to help install software in a "cross plataform" way, that you don't have to know in what OS, version or distribution you are running your system JIT will install the package automatically.
